# Fuzzing 
This repository contains my attempts at building different types of fuzzers to learn more about fuzzing. 

## Pre-requisites
Should you wish to try my scripts, these packages are required:
* [pwntools](https://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/install.html)
* [gdb](http://www.gdbtutorial.com/tutorial/how-install-gdb)

I usually work with [gdb-gef](https://github.com/hugsy/gef), but the normal version *should* work fine.

## Types of Fuzzers
### Dumb Fuzzer
The name speaks for itself. It's a dumb fuzzer, which makes use of simple mutation strategies and a corpus.

### Genetic Fuzzer
To be done.

### Reinforcement Learning Fuzzer
To be done, maybe.
